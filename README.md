# FreeCAD Macro: Create Cutviews for Assemblies and Parts

This FreeCAD macro automates the creation, management, and deletion of "cut views" for assemblies and parts.  
It is designed for advanced workflows, supporting both single parts and complex assemblies (including links and nested structures).  
**Compatible with both the Part and PartDesign workbenches.**

## How to Use

### 1. Preparation

- Open your desired FreeCAD document.
- Select either:
  - a body or assembly **and** a cutting plane to create a new cut view, or
  - an existing cutview group to delete it.

### 2. Creating a New Cut View

1. **Select object and plane:**  
   In the model tree, select a body/assembly and an existing plane (DatumPlane/Plane).
2. **Run the macro:**  
   A dialog will appear. Choose a letter for the section label and the rectangle size (for the cut cube).
3. **Confirm your choices:**  
   The macro will automatically generate sub-links and the corresponding cut cubes, and perform the cutting operation.

### 3. Deleting an Existing Cutview

- Select a group in the model tree whose name starts with `Cut_` (e.g., `Cut_A`).
- Run the macro again.  
  A dialog will open, giving you the option to delete the entire group.

## Notes & Tips

- Coplanar faces at the cut will be **highlighted in dark red** to improve visibility.
- Objects are automatically grouped under main and subgroups for clarity.
- Works with both individual parts and complex assemblies with nested structures and links.
